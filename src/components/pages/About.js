                                The main gameplay feature is the bosses change from stage to stage. Based on how a boss
                                is destroyed, the next boss will adapt itself to defend against previously used
                                strategies and force the player to change tactics. For example, if the front section of
                                one boss is destroyed the next boss will have increased armor in that area. If the
                                player&apos;s ship is hit by a certain kind of weapon, but still defeats the boss,
                                the next boss is likely to have more weapons of that type.

                                Merchant aims to reimagine the traditional mobile RPG. In Merchant, players take the
                                role of a shopkeeper who must manage a team of Heroes and Crafters. Heroes are sent out
                                on quests in order to fight enemies and gather materials. Crafters then use those
                                materials to create weapons and armor. As the shopkeeper, players must balance their
                                micro-economies between selling items for gold and crafting items to better ensure
                                success for the Heroes. As the Merchant, you are the commander of your own domain!

                                furnaces which can smelt food, process ores and materials, among others.
